# md-hex-viewer
A hex viewer which runs directly on the Sega Mega Drive. To change the base address press the d-pad left/right or up/down. Accessing certain memory addresses on the Sega Genesis will cause a hard crash, and this application is no exception to that.

This is of limited utility alone, but could prove useful as part of an exception handler or other debugger software.
